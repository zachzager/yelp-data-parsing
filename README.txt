Yelp Data Wrangling and Organization
March 2018

Overview:
I compiled four datasets into a single sheet for better analysis.
My goal was to acquire as much information on individual business
locations as possible in the United States. This involved reconfiguring
the way checkins were stored to better understand when people are checking in.
